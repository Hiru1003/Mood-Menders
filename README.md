# Mood-Menders
A mental health tracking app

Mood-Menders, a mental health tracking app, is a collaborative initiative by software engineering undergraduates from NSBM Green University. The app is specifically designed to support university undergraduates facing mental health challenges. Our focus in developing this innovative app revolves around utilizing Flutter and Firebase technologies. Flutter ensures a seamless and visually appealing user interface, while Firebase integration allows real-time data synchronization, enabling users to access their mental health history across multiple devices. Prioritizing user privacy and data security, Mood-Menders implements robust encryption measures. The app goes beyond mood tracking, offering additional resources such as self-help articles, coping mechanisms, and access to professional mental health support. Regular updates are planned to keep the app aligned with evolving user needs. With a user-driven development approach and feedback mechanisms, Mood-Menders encourages active user engagement. This collaborative effort among NSBM Green University undergraduates brings together diverse skills, fostering creativity and innovation in app development. The ultimate goal is to positively contribute to the overall well-being of the student community.
